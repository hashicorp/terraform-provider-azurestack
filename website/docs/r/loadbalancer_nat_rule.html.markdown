# azurestack_lb_nat_rule

Manages a LoadBalancer NAT Rule.

~> **NOTE** When using this resource, the LoadBalancer needs to have a FrontEnd IP Configuration Attached

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurestack_resource_group" "test" {
  name     = "LoadBalancerRG"
  location = "West US"
}

resource "azurestack_public_ip" "test" {
  name                         = "PublicIPForLB"
  location                     = "West US"
  resource_group_name          = "${azurestack_resource_group.test.name}"
  public_ip_address_allocation = "static"
}

resource "azurestack_lb" "test" {
  name                = "TestLoadBalancer"
  location            = "West US"
  resource_group_name = "${azurestack_resource_group.test.name}"

  frontend_ip_configuration {
    name                 = "PublicIPAddress"
    public_ip_address_id = "${azurestack_public_ip.test.id}"
  }
}

resource "azurestack_lb_nat_rule" "test" {
  resource_group_name            = "${azurestack_resource_group.test.name}"
  loadbalancer_id                = "${azurestack_lb.test.id}"
  name                           = "RDPAccess"
  protocol                       = "Tcp"
  frontend_port                  = 3389
  backend_port                   = 3389
  frontend_ip_configuration_name = "PublicIPAddress"
}
```
