# azurestack_local_network_gateway

Manages a local network gateway connection over which specific connections can be configured.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurestack_resource_group" "test" {
  name     = "localNetworkGWTest"
  location = "West US"
}

resource "azurestack_local_network_gateway" "home" {
  name                = "backHome"
  resource_group_name = "${azurestack_resource_group.test.name}"
  location            = "${azurestack_resource_group.test.location}"
  gateway_address     = "12.13.14.15"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the local network gateway. Changing this

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to
    create the local network gateway.

* `location` - (Required) The location/region where the local network gateway is
    created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `gateway_address` - (Required) The IP address of the gateway to which to
    connect.

* `address_space` - (Required) The list of string CIDRs representing the
    address spaces the gateway exposes.

* `bgp_settings` - (Optional) A `bgp_settings` block as defined below containing the
    Local Network Gateway's BGP speaker settings.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

`bgp_settings` supports the following:

* `asn` - (Required) The BGP speaker's ASN.

* `bgp_peering_address` - (Required) The BGP peering address and BGP identifier
    of this BGP speaker.

* `peer_weight` - (Optional) The weight added to routes learned from this
    BGP speaker.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The local network gateway unique ID within Azure.
